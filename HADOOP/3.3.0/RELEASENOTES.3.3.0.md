* [HADOOP-14833](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14833) | *Major* | **Remove s3a user:secret authentication**

After this patch, the S3A connector no longer supports username and secrets in URLs of the form \`s3a://key:secret@bucket/\`. It is near-impossible to stop those secrets being logged â€”which is why a warning has been printed since Hadoop 2.8 whenever such a URL was used.

Fix: use a more secure mechanism to pass down the secrets.
