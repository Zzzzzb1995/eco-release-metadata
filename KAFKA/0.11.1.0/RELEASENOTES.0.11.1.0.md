* [KAFKA-5289](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5289) | *Critical* | **One StopReplicaRequest will caused two Responses**

After discussed with my friend markTCï¼Œwe find a bug.
One StopReplicaRequest will caused two Responses.

At core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaApi.class 175 and 176 lines.

When an exception caused at 'replicaManager.replicaFetcherManager.shutdownIdleFetcherThreads()', 
will also return two responses.

one is at 175 lines 'requestChannel.sendResponse(new RequestChannel.Response(request, new ResponseSend(request.connectionId, responseHeader, response)))' and another at 111 lines 'requestChannel.sendResponse(new Response(request, new ResponseSend(request.connectionId, respHeader, response)))'.
