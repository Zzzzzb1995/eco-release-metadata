* [PIG-4578](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4578) | *Minor* | **ToDateISO should support optional \' \' space variant used by JDBC**

Built-in UDF ToDateISO(chararray) now allows a space character instead of requiring a \'T\' between date and time in an ISO-8601 timestamp. Facilitates parsing of JDBC timestamp format.


---

* [PIG-4365](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4365) | *Major* | **TOP udf should implement Accumulator interface**

TOP udf implements Accumulator interface


---

* [PIG-4405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4405) | *Major* | **Adding \'map[]\' support to mock/Storage**

The Storage mocking feature supports input and output of "map" types.


---

* [PIG-4638](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4638) | *Major* | **Allow TOMAP to accept dynamically sized input**

The TOMAP function now also accepts a bag of key-value pairs as input.


---

* [PIG-4639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4639) | *Major* | **Add better parser for Apache HTTPD access log.**

In piggybank there is now a generic Apache httpd access log loader that supports (almost) all custom LogFormats.


---

* [PIG-4673](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4673) | *Minor* | **Built In UDF - REPLACE\_MULTI : For a given string, search and replace all occurrences of search keys with replacement values.**

Built In UDF - REPLACE\_MULTI : Method which take a tuple having source string as first parameter and a map having search key and replacement values. Method will replace all occurrences of search key in source string with the replacement values.

* [PIG-4691](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4691) | *Major* | **[Pig on Tez] Support for whitelisting storefuncs for union optimization**

Union optimization (pig.tez.opt.union=true) in tez uses vertex groups to store output from different vertices into one final output location. If a StoreFunc\'s OutputCommitter does not honor mapreduce.output.basename or has other issues with multiple vertices writing to the destination location at the same time, then you can disable union optimization just for that StoreFunc. Refer PIG-4649. You can also specify a whitelist of StoreFuncs that are known to work with multiple vertices writing to same location instead of a blacklist.

#pig.tez.opt.union.unsupported.storefuncs=org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer,org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer
#pig.tez.opt.union.supported.storefuncs=

* [PIG-3251](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-3251) | *Major* | **Bzip2TextInputFormat requires double the memory of maximum record size**

With hadoop 2.X or later, pig will use hadoop\'s bzip codec to handle bzip inputs.  (To turn it off, set pig.bzip.use.hadoop.inputformat=false)

Support for logging in into a Kerberos secured Hadoop cluster using a keytab file to allow running jobs that last longer than the maximum Kerberos ticket lifetime.


---

* [PIG-4581](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4581) | *Trivial* | **thread safe issue in NodeIdGenerator**

ThreadSafe version of NodeIdGenerator


---

* [PIG-4526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4526) | *Major* | **Make setting up the build environment easier**

---

* [PIG-4880](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-4880) | *Major* | **Overlapping of parameter substitution names inside&outside a macro fails with NPE**
