This mainly acts as a test of [Apache Yetus](https://yetus.apache.org)'s [releasedocmaker](https://yetus.apache.org/documentation/in-progress/releasedocmaker/).  It queries Apache's JIRA instance for data and populates the tables.  I run it every-so-often, usually when I'm testing new features.

If you'd like to have your project added, drop me a line. If your project would like to use releasedocmaker for your releasenotes, drop us a line at dev@yetus.apache.org.  We'll be more than happy to help.

NOTE: Like most of my work, the real stuff is over on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/_a__w_/eco-release-metadata).
