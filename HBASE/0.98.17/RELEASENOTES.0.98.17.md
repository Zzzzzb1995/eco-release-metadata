# Apache HBase  0.98.17 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-14793](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14793) | *Major* | **Allow limiting size of block into L1 block cache.**

Very large blocks can fragment the heap and cause bad issues for the garbage collector, especially the G1GC. Now there is a maximum size that a block can be and still stick in the LruBlockCache. That size defaults to 16mb but can be controlled by changing "hbase.lru.max.block.size"


---

* [HBASE-14799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14799) | *Critical* | **Commons-collections object deserialization remote command execution vulnerability**

This issue resolves a potential security vulnerability. For all versions we update our commons-collections dependency to the release that fixes the reported vulnerability in that library. In 0.98 we additionally disable by default a feature of code carried from 0.94 for backwards compatibility that is not needed.


---

* [HBASE-14926](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14926) | *Major* | **Hung ThriftServer; no timeout on read from client; if client crashes, worker thread gets stuck reading**

Adds a timeout to server read from clients. Adds new configs hbase.thrift.server.socket.read.timeout for setting read timeout on server socket in milliseconds. Default is 60000;


---

* [HBASE-14960](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14960) | *Major* | **Fallback to using default RPCControllerFactory if class cannot be loaded**

If the configured RPC controller factory (via hbase.rpc.controllerfactory.class) cannot be found in the classpath or loaded, we fall back to using the default RPC controller factory in HBase.


---

* [HBASE-14822](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14822) | *Major* | **Renewing leases of scanners doesn't work**

And 1.1, 1.0, and 0.98.


---

* [HBASE-14976](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14976) | *Minor* | **Add RPC call queues to the web ui**

Adds column displaying current aggregated call queues size in region server queues tab UI.


---

* [HBASE-14468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14468) | *Major* | **Compaction improvements: FIFO compaction policy**

FIFO compaction policy selects only files which have all cells expired. The column family MUST have non-default TTL. 
Essentially, FIFO compactor does only one job: collects expired store files. 

Because we do not do any real compaction, we do not use CPU and IO (disk and network), we do not evict hot data from a block cache. The result: improved throughput and latency both write and read.
See: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/FIFO-compaction-style


---

* [HBASE-14355](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14355) | *Major* | **Scan different TimeRange for each column family**

Adds being able to Scan each column family with a different time range. Adds new methods setColumnFamilyTimeRange and getColumnFamilyTimeRange to Scan.
