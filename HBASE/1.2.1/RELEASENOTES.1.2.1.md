* [HBASE-15219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15219) | *Critical* | **Canary tool does not return non-zero exit code when one of regions is in stuck state**

* [HBASE-15290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15290) | *Major* | **Hbase Rest CheckAndAPI should save other cells along with compared cell**

Fixed an issue in REST server checkAndPut operation where the remaining cells other than the to-be-checked column are also applied in the put operation .

* [HBASE-15354](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15354) | *Major* | **Use same criteria for clearing meta cache for all operations**

This patch fixes some issues when MetaCache (region location cache) gets unnecessarily dropped on the client.

On master branch we now in RegionServerCallable and RegionServerAdminCallable pass the actual exception down to Connection#updateCachedLocation, so we could check there if the exception is "meta-clearing" or not.

on branch-1, branch-1.2 and branch 1.3 we now check if the exception is meta-clearing or not in AsyncProcess (this check was there on master, but not on earlier branches)
