* [HBASE-13564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13564) | *Major* | **Master MBeans are not published**

To use the coprocessor-based JMX implementation provided by HBase for Master.
Add below property in hbase-site.xml file: 

\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.coprocessor.master.classes\</name\>
  \<value\>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.JMXListener\</value\>
\</property\>

NOTE: DO NOT set `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` for Java VM at the same time.

By default, the JMX listens on TCP port 10101 for Master, we can further configure the port using below properties:

\<property\>
  \<name\>master.rmi.registry.port\</name\>
  \<value\>61110\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>master.rmi.connector.port\</name\>
  \<value\>61120\</value\>
\</property\>
----

The registry port can be shared with connector port in most cases, so you only need to configure master.rmi.registry.port.
However if you want to use SSL communication, the 2 ports must be configured to different values.

* [HBASE-13625](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13625) | *Major* | **Use HDFS for HFileOutputFormat2 partitioner's path**

Introduces a new config hbase.fs.tmp.dir which is a directory in HDFS (or default file system) to use as a staging directory for HFileOutputFormat2. This is also used as the default for hbase.bulkload.staging.dir


---

* [HBASE-13938](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13938) | *Major* | **Deletes done during the region merge transaction may get eclipsed**

Use the master's timestamp when sending hbase:meta edits on region merge to ensure proper ordering of new region addition and old region deletes.


---

* [HBASE-13959](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13959) | *Critical* | **Region splitting uses a single thread in most common cases**

The performance of region splitting has been improved by using a thread pool to split the store files concurrently. Prior to this change, the store files were always split sequentially in a single thread, so a region with multiple store files ended up taking several seconds. The thread pool is sized dynamically with the aim of getting maximum concurrency, without exceeding the number of cores available for HBase Java process. A lower limit for the thread pool can be explicitly set using the property hbase.regionserver.region.split.threads.max.


---

* [HBASE-13983](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13983) | *Minor* | **Doc how the oddball HTable methods getStartKey, getEndKey, etc. will be removed in 2.0.0**

Adds extra doc on getStartKeys, getEndKeys, and getStartEndKeys in HTable explaining that they will be removed in 2.0.0 (these methods did not get the proper full major version deprecation cycle).

In this issue, we actually also remove these methods in master/2.0.0 branch.


---

* [HBASE-13632](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13632) | *Trivial* | **Backport HBASE-13368 to branch-1 and 0.98**

Several utility classes related to making message digests were mistakenly marked InterfaceAudience.Public. This change corrects them to be InterfaceAudience.Private. Though this change itself will not break downstream users future changes may happen to these classes in patch releases. As such, downstream users are strongly encouraged to migrate away from uses the following classes in the org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util package: Hash, JenkinsHash, MurmurHash, and MurmurHash3.


---

* [HBASE-13764](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13764) | *Minor* | **Backport HBASE-7782 (HBaseTestingUtility.truncateTable() not acting like CLI) to branch-1.x**

HBaseTestingUtility now uses the truncate API added in HBASE-8332 so that calls to HBTU.truncateTable will behave like the shell command: effectively dropping the table and recreating a new one with the same split points. 

Previously, HBTU.truncateTable instead issued deletes for all the data already in the table. If you wish to maintain the same behavior, you should use the newly added HBTU.deleteTableData method.


---

* [HBASE-13881](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13881) | *Major* | **Bug in HTable#incrementColumnValue implementation**

HBASE-13881 Correct HTable incrementColumnValue implementation


---

* [HBASE-13865](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13865) | *Trivial* | **Increase the default value for hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multipler from 2 to 4 (part 2)**

Increase default hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier from 2 to 4 in the code to match the default value in the config files.


---

* [HBASE-14054](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14054) | *Major* | **Acknowledged writes may get lost if regionserver clock is set backwards**

In {{checkAndPut}} write path use max(max timestamp for the row, System.currentTimeMillis()) in the, instead of blindly taking System.currentTimeMillis() to ensure that checkAndPut() cannot do writes which is already eclipsed. This is similar to what has been done in HBASE-12449 for increment and append.


---

* [HBASE-10844](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10844) | *Major* | **Coprocessor failure during batchmutation leaves the memstore datastructs in an inconsistent state**

Promotes an -ea assert to logged FATAL and RS abort when memstore is found to be in an inconsistent state.


---

* [HBASE-13127](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13127) | *Major* | **Add timeouts on all tests so less zombie sightings**

Use junit facility to impose timeout on test. Use test category to chose which timeout to apply: small tests timeout after 30 seconds, medium tests after 180 seconds, and large tests after ten minutes.

Updated junit version from 4.11 to 4.12. 4.12 has support for feature used here.

Add this at the head of your junit4 class to add a category-based timeout:

{code}
@Rule public final TestRule timeout =   CategoryBasedTimeout.builder().withTimeout(this.getClass()).
      withLookingForStuckThread(true).build();
{code}

For example:


---

* [HBASE-14224](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14224) | *Critical* | **Fix coprocessor handling of duplicate classes**

Prevent Coprocessors being doubly-loaded; a particular coprocessor can only be loaded once.
