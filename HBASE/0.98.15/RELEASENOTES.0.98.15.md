# Apache HBase  0.98.15 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-14224](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14224) | *Critical* | **Fix coprocessor handling of duplicate classes**

Prevent Coprocessors being doubly-loaded; a particular coprocessor can only be loaded once.

* [HBASE-14261](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14261) | *Major* | **Enhance Chaos Monkey framework by adding zookeeper and datanode fault injections.**

This change augments existing chaos monkey framework with actions for restarting underlying zookeeper quorum and hdfs nodes of distributed hbase cluster. One assumption made while creating zk actions are that zookeper ensemble is an independent external service and won't be managed by hbase cluster.  For these actions to work as expected, the following parameters need to be configured appropriately.

{code}
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.hadoop.home\</name\>
  \<value\>$HADOOP\_HOME\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.zookeeper.home\</name\>
  \<value\>$ZOOKEEPER\_HOME\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.hbase.user\</name\>
  \<value\>hbase\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.hadoop.hdfs.user\</name\>
  \<value\>hdfs\</value\>
\</property\>
\<property\>
  \<name\>hbase.it.clustermanager.zookeeper.user\</name\>
  \<value\>zookeeper\</value\>
\</property\>
{code}

The service user related configurations are newly introduced since in prod/test environments each service is managed by different user. Once the above parameters are configured properly, you can start using them as needed. An example usage for invoking these new actions is:

{{./hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.IntegrationTestAcidGuarantees -m serverAndDependenciesKilling}}

* [HBASE-14400](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14400) | *Critical* | **Fix HBase RPC protection documentation**

To use rpc protection in HBase, set the value of 'hbase.rpc.protection' to:
'authentication' : simple authentication using kerberos
'integrity' : authentication and integrity
'privacy' : authentication and confidentiality

Earlier, HBase reference guide erroneously mentioned in some places to set the value to 'auth-conf'. This patch fixes the guide and adds temporary support for erroneously recommended values.


---

* [HBASE-14475](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14475) | *Major* | **Region split requests are always audited with "hbase" user rather than request user**

Region observer notifications w.r.t. split request are now audited with request user through proper scope of doAs() calls.
