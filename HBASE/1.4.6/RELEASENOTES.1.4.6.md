* [HBASE-20723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20723) | *Critical* | **Custom hbase.wal.dir results in data loss because we write recovered edits into a different place than where the recovering region server looks for them**

Previously custom hbase.wal.dir, which is not on the same filesystem as hbase rootdir, results in data loss because we write recovered edits into a different place than where the recovering region server looks for them. This is fixed by retrieving actual recovered edits from the correct location.

* [HBASE-20884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20884) | *Major* | **Replace usage of our Base64 implementation with java.util.Base64**

Class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Base64 has been removed in it's entirety from HBase 2+. In HBase 1, unused methods have been removed from the class and the audience was changed from  Public to Private. This class was originally intended as an internal utility class that could be used externally but thinking since changed; these classes should not have been advertised as public to end-users.

This represents an incompatible change for users who relied on this implementation. An alternative implementation for affected clients is available at java.util.Base64 when using Java 8 or newer; be aware, it may encode/decode differently. For clients seeking to restore this specific implementation, it is available in the public domain for download at http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/
