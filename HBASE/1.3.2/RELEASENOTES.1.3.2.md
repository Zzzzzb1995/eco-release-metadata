# Apache HBase  1.3.2 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-17514](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17514) | *Minor* | **Warn when Thrift Server 1 is configured for proxy users but not the HTTP transport**

If users of the Thrift 1 Server enable proxy user support without enabling the prerequisite HTTP transport, we now log a WARN message about the mismatch.


---

* [HBASE-17877](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17877) | *Major* | **Improve HBase's byte[] comparator**

updated the lexicographic byte array comparator to use a slightly more optimized version similar to the one available in the guava library that compares only the first index where left[index] != right[index]. The comparator also returns the diff directly instead of mapping it to -1, 0, +1 range as was being done in the earlier version. We have seen significant performance gains, calculated in terms of throughput (ops/ms) with these changes ranging from approx 20% for smaller byte arrays upto 200 bytes and almost 100% for large byte array sizes that are in few KB's. We benchmarked with upto 16KB arrays and the general trend indicates that the performance improvement increases as the size of the byte array increases.


---

* [HBASE-17817](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17817) | *Major* | **Make Regionservers log which tables it removed coprocessors from when aborting**

Add table name to exception logging when a coprocessor is removed from a table by the region server


---

* [HBASE-17887](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17887) | *Blocker* | **Row-level consistency is broken for read**

Now we pass on list of memstoreScanners to the StoreScanner along with the new files to ensure that the StoreScanner sees the latest memstore after flush.


---

* [HBASE-18122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18122) | *Major* | **Scanner id should include ServerName of region server**

The scanner id is not from 1 anymore.
The first 32 bits are MurmurHash32 of ServerName string "host,port,ts". The ServerName contains both host, port, and start timestamp so it can prevent collision. The lowest 32bit is generated by atomic int.


---

* [HBASE-9393](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9393) | *Critical* | **Hbase does not closing a closed socket resulting in many CLOSE\_WAIT**

To handle this issue client need to have Hadoop client 2.6.4 or 2.7.0+ Hadoop version as CanUnBuffer interface which was added as part of HDFS-7694 is available in only those versions.


---

* [HBASE-18192](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18192) | *Blocker* | **Replication drops recovered queues on region server shutdown**

If a region server that is processing recovered queue for another previously dead region server is gracefully shut down, it can drop the recovered queue under certain conditions. Running without this fix on a 1.2+ release means possibility of continuing data loss in replication, irrespective of which WALProvider is used.
If a single WAL group (or DefaultWALProvider) is used, running without this fix will always cause dataloss in replication whenever a region server processing recovered queues is gracefully shutdown.


---

* [HBASE-18137](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18137) | *Critical* | **Replication gets stuck for empty WALs**

0-length WAL files can potentially cause the replication queue to get stuck.  A new config "replication.source.eof.autorecovery" has been added: if set to true (default is false), the 0-length WAL file will be skipped after 1) the max number of retries has been hit, and 2) there are more WAL files in the queue.  The risk of enabling this is that there is a chance the 0-length WAL file actually has some data (e.g. block went missing and will come back once a datanode is recovered).


---

* [HBASE-18255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18255) | *Critical* | **Time-Delayed HBase Performance Degradation with Java 7**

This change sets the JVM property ReservedCodeCacheSize to 256MB in the provided hbase-env.sh example file. The specific value for this property attempts to prevent performance issues seen when HBase using Java 7. The value set is the same as the default when using Java8.


---

* [HBASE-16090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16090) | *Major* | **ResultScanner is not closed in SyncTable#finishRemainingHashRanges()**

pushed to 1.3 and 1.2. SyncTable was introduced in 1.2, so skipping 1.1.


---

* [HBASE-18023](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18023) | *Minor* | **Log multi-\* requests for more than threshold number of rows**

HBASE-18023 introduces a warning message in the RegionServer log when an RPC is received from a client that has more than 5000 "actions" (where an "action" is a collection of mutations for a specific row) in a single RPC. Misbehaving clients who send large RPCs to RegionServers can be malicious, causing temporary pauses via garbage collection or denial of service via crashes. The threshold of 5000 actions per RPC is defined by the property "hbase.rpc.rows.warning.threshold" in hbase-site.xml.


---

* [HBASE-18387](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18387) | *Minor* | **[Thrift] Make principal configurable in DemoClient.java**

This change allows the demonstration Thrift client to customize the server principal used by the Thrift server for instances secured with Kerberos.


---

* [HBASE-18631](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18631) | *Minor* | **Allow configuration of ChaosMonkey properties via hbase-site**

This change invalidates the need for a separate Java properties file to configure the ChaosMonkey included with HBase. These properties can be provided directly in hbase-site.xml. If configuration in provided in both locations, the Java properties file takes precendence.
