# Apache HBase  1.3.2 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-17514](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17514) | *Minor* | **Warn when Thrift Server 1 is configured for proxy users but not the HTTP transport**

If users of the Thrift 1 Server enable proxy user support without enabling the prerequisite HTTP transport, we now log a WARN message about the mismatch.


---

* [HBASE-17877](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17877) | *Major* | **Improve HBase's byte[] comparator**

updated the lexicographic byte array comparator to use a slightly more optimized version similar to the one available in the guava library that compares only the first index where left[index] != right[index]. The comparator also returns the diff directly instead of mapping it to -1, 0, +1 range as was being done in the earlier version. We have seen significant performance gains, calculated in terms of throughput (ops/ms) with these changes ranging from approx 20% for smaller byte arrays upto 200 bytes and almost 100% for large byte array sizes that are in few KB's. We benchmarked with upto 16KB arrays and the general trend indicates that the performance improvement increases as the size of the byte array increases.


---

* [HBASE-17817](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17817) | *Major* | **Make Regionservers log which tables it removed coprocessors from when aborting**

Add table name to exception logging when a coprocessor is removed from a table by the region server


---

* [HBASE-17887](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-17887) | *Blocker* | **Row-level consistency is broken for read**

Now we pass on list of memstoreScanners to the StoreScanner along with the new files to ensure that the StoreScanner sees the latest memstore after flush.


---

* [HBASE-18122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-18122) | *Major* | **Scanner id should include ServerName of region server**

The scanner id is not from 1 anymore.
The first 32 bits are MurmurHash32 of ServerName string "host,port,ts". The ServerName contains both host, port, and start timestamp so it can prevent collision. The lowest 32bit is generated by atomic int.
