# Apache HBase  0.94.28 Release Notes

These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.


---

* [HBASE-14799](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14799) | *Critical* | **Commons-collections object deserialization remote command execution vulnerability**

This issue resolves a potential security vulnerability. For all versions we update our commons-collections dependency to the release that fixes the reported vulnerability in that library. In 0.98 we additionally disable by default a feature of code carried from 0.94 for backwards compatibility that is not needed.

* [HBASE-15054](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15054) | *Major* | **Allow 0.94 to compile with JDK8**

This change replaces 
public boolean remove(K key, V value) in PoolMap
with
public boolean removeValue(K key, V value)

Direct users of PoolMap will need to change the code accordingly.
