* [SPARK-12016](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12016) | *Major* | **word2vec load model can\'t use findSynonyms to get words**

I use word2vec.fit to train a word2vecModel and then save the model to file system. when I load the model from file system, I found I can use transform(\'a\') to get a vector, but I can\'t use findSynonyms(\'a\', 2) to get some words.

I use the fellow code to test word2vec

from pyspark import SparkContext
from pyspark.mllib.feature import Word2Vec, Word2VecModel

import os, tempfile
from shutil import rmtree

if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':
    sc = SparkContext(\'local\', \'test\')
    sentence = "a b " \* 100 + "a c " \* 10
    localDoc = [sentence, sentence]
    doc = sc.parallelize(localDoc).map(lambda line: line.split(" "))
    model = Word2Vec().setVectorSize(10).setSeed(42).fit(doc)

    syms = model.findSynonyms("a", 2)
    print [s[0] for s in syms]
    path = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    model.save(sc, path)
    sameModel = Word2VecModel.load(sc, path)
    print model.transform("a") == sameModel.transform("a")
    syms = sameModel.findSynonyms("a", 2)
    print [s[0] for s in syms]
    try:
        rmtree(path)
    except OSError:
        pass

I got "[u\'b\', u\'c\']" when the first printf
then the “True” and " [u\'\_\_class\_\_\'] "
I don\'t know how to get \'b\' or \'c\' with sameModel.findSynonyms("a", 2)
