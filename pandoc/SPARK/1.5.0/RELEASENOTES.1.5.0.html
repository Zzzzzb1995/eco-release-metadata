<h1 id="apache-spark-1.5.0-release-notes">Apache Spark 1.5.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10578">SPARK-10578</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifer does not return <code>rawPrediction</code> column</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To use <code>pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifer</code> with <code>BinaryClassificationEvaluator</code>, a column called <code>rawPrediction</code> needs to be returned by the <code>RandomForestClassifer</code>. The PySpark documentation example of <code>logisticsRegression</code>outputs the <code>rawPrediction</code> column but not <code>RandomForestClassifier</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, one is unable to use <code>RandomForestClassifier</code> with the evaluator nor put it in a pipeline with cross validation.</p>
<p>A relevant piece of code showing how to reproduce the bug can be found at: https://gist.github.com/karenyyng/cf61ae655b032f754bfb</p>
<p>A relevant post due to this possible bug can also be found at: http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/Issue-with-running-CrossValidator-with-RandomForestClassifier-on-dataset-td23791.html</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6936">SPARK-6936</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>SQLContext.sql() caused deadlock in multi-thread env</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Doing (the same query) in more than one threads with SQLConext.sql may lead to deadlock. Here is a way to reproduce it (since this is multi-thread issue, the reproduction may or may not be so easy).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Register a relatively big table.</p></li>
<li><p>Create two different classes and in the classes, do the same query in a method and put the results in a set and print out the set size.</p></li>
<li><p>Create two threads to use an object from each class in the run method. Start the threads. For my tests, it can have a deadlock just in a few runs.</p></li>
</ol>
