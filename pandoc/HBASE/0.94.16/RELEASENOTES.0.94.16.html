<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.94.16-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.94.16 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10225">HBASE-10225</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Bug in calls to RegionObsever.postScannerFilterRow</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This fix breaks src compatibility. If users try recompiling their CP impl with new HBase jar, they MAY have to change. (If they have overridden this method) This does not break binary compatibility</p>
