<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.20.4-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.20.4 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2190">HBASE-2190</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>HRS should report to master when HMsg are available</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This requires that making a rolling update, you upgrade the master first (so it knows what to do w/ the new split signal this patch introduces).</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2378">HBASE-2378</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Bulk insert with multiple reducers broken due to improper ImmutableBytesWritable comparator</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING: No release note provided for this change.</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2422">HBASE-2422</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Remove fragmentation indicator for 0.20.4... fix in 0.20.5.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WARNING: No release note provided for this change.</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-2248">HBASE-2248</a> | <em>Blocker</em> | <strong>Provide new non-copy mechanism to assure atomic reads in get and scan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This patch changes the Get code path to instead be a Scan of one row. This means than inserting cells out of timestamp order should work now (tests to verify to follow part of hbase-2294) but also that a delete at an explicit timestamp now overshadows EVEN if the effected cell is put after the delete (The old Get code path did early-out so a subsequent puts would not see the delete).</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1892">HBASE-1892</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>[performance] make hbase splits run faster</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>On region close, this change makes it so we don't wait on compaction to complete with the close-region flag in place -- i.e. region is offline while we wait on the compaction close -- and secondly, if the region memstores are over a configurable limit, before closing, we'll run a &quot;pre-flush&quot; to get the bulk of the memory flushed before we put the close flag up.</p>
