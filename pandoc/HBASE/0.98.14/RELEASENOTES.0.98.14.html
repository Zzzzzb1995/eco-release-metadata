<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.98.14-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.98.14 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13938">HBASE-13938</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Deletes done during the region merge transaction may get eclipsed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Use the master's timestamp when sending hbase:meta edits on region merge to ensure proper ordering of new region addition and old region deletes.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13959">HBASE-13959</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Region splitting uses a single thread in most common cases</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of region splitting has been improved by using a thread pool to split the store files concurrently. Prior to this change, the store files were always split sequentially in a single thread, so a region with multiple store files ended up taking several seconds. The thread pool is sized dynamically with the aim of getting maximum concurrency, without exceeding the number of cores available for HBase Java process. A lower limit for the thread pool can be explicitly set using the property hbase.regionserver.region.split.threads.max.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13639">HBASE-13639</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>SyncTable - rsync for HBase tables</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Tool to sync two tables that tries to send the differences only like rsync.</p>
<p>Adds two new MapReduce jobs, SyncTable and HashTable. See usage for these jobs on how to use. See design doc for generally overview: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-2c9kJEWNrXf5V4q_wBcoIXfdchN7Pxvxv1IO6PW0-U/edit</p>
<p>From comments below, &quot;It can be challenging to run against a table getting live writes, if those writes are updates/overwrites. In general, you can run it against a time range to ignore new writes, but if those writes update existing cells, then the time range scan may or may not see older versions of those cells depending on whether major compaction has happened, which may be different in remote clusters.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13646">HBASE-13646</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>HRegion#execService should not try to build incomplete messages</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When RegionServerCoprocessors throw an exception we will no longer attempt to build an incomplete RPC response message. Instead, the response message will be null.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13849">HBASE-13849</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Remove restore and clone snapshot from the WebUI</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The HBase master status web page no longer allows operators to clone snapshots nor restore snapshots.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13881">HBASE-13881</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Bug in HTable#incrementColumnValue implementation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HBASE-13881 Correct HTable incrementColumnValue implementation</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13865">HBASE-13865</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>Increase the default value for hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multipler from 2 to 4 (part 2)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Increase default hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier from 2 to 4 in the code to match the default value in the config files.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13985">HBASE-13985</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Add configuration to skip validating HFile format when bulk loading</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A new config, hbase.loadincremental.validate.hfile , is introduced - default to true When set to false, checking hfile format is skipped during bulkloading.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14054">HBASE-14054</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Acknowledged writes may get lost if regionserver clock is set backwards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In {{checkAndPut}} write path use max(max timestamp for the row, System.currentTimeMillis()) in the, instead of blindly taking System.currentTimeMillis() to ensure that checkAndPut() cannot do writes which is already eclipsed. This is similar to what has been done in HBASE-12449 for increment and append.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13706">HBASE-13706</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>CoprocessorClassLoader should not exempt Hive classes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from HBase 2.0, CoprocessorClassLoader will not exempt hadoop classes or zookeeper classes. This means that if the custom coprocessor jar contains hadoop or zookeeper packages and classes, they will be loaded by the CoprocessorClassLoader. Only hbase packages and classes are exempted from the CoprocessorClassLoader. They (and their dependencies) are loaded by the parent server class loader.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10844">HBASE-10844</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Coprocessor failure during batchmutation leaves the memstore datastructs in an inconsistent state</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Promotes an -ea assert to logged FATAL and RS abort when memstore is found to be in an inconsistent state.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-13963">HBASE-13963</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>avoid leaking jdk.tools</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>HBase now ensures that the JDK tools jar used during the build process is not exposed to downstream clients as a transitive dependency of hbase-annotations.</p>
<p>If you need to have the JDK tools jar in your classpath, you should add a system dependency on it. See the hbase-annotations pom for an example of the necessary pom additions.</p>
