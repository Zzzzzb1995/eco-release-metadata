<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.98.17-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.98.17 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14793">HBASE-14793</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Allow limiting size of block into L1 block cache.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Very large blocks can fragment the heap and cause bad issues for the garbage collector, especially the G1GC. Now there is a maximum size that a block can be and still stick in the LruBlockCache. That size defaults to 16mb but can be controlled by changing &quot;hbase.lru.max.block.size&quot;</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14799">HBASE-14799</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Commons-collections object deserialization remote command execution vulnerability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This issue resolves a potential security vulnerability. For all versions we update our commons-collections dependency to the release that fixes the reported vulnerability in that library. In 0.98 we additionally disable by default a feature of code carried from 0.94 for backwards compatibility that is not needed.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14926">HBASE-14926</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Hung ThriftServer; no timeout on read from client; if client crashes, worker thread gets stuck reading</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds a timeout to server read from clients. Adds new configs hbase.thrift.server.socket.read.timeout for setting read timeout on server socket in milliseconds. Default is 60000;</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14960">HBASE-14960</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Fallback to using default RPCControllerFactory if class cannot be loaded</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If the configured RPC controller factory (via hbase.rpc.controllerfactory.class) cannot be found in the classpath or loaded, we fall back to using the default RPC controller factory in HBase.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14822">HBASE-14822</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Renewing leases of scanners doesn't work</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And 1.1, 1.0, and 0.98.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14976">HBASE-14976</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Add RPC call queues to the web ui</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds column displaying current aggregated call queues size in region server queues tab UI.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14468">HBASE-14468</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Compaction improvements: FIFO compaction policy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FIFO compaction policy selects only files which have all cells expired. The column family MUST have non-default TTL. Essentially, FIFO compactor does only one job: collects expired store files.</p>
<p>Because we do not do any real compaction, we do not use CPU and IO (disk and network), we do not evict hot data from a block cache. The result: improved throughput and latency both write and read. See: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/FIFO-compaction-style</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14355">HBASE-14355</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Scan different TimeRange for each column family</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds being able to Scan each column family with a different time range. Adds new methods setColumnFamilyTimeRange and getColumnFamilyTimeRange to Scan.</p>
