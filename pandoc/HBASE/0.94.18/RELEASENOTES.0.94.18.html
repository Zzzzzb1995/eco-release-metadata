<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9778">HBASE-9778</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Add hint to ExplicitColumnTracker to avoid seeking</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Introduces a new scan attribute to allow a scan operation with explicit columns (Scan.addColumn) to opportunistically look ahead a few KeyValues (columns/versions) before scheduling a seek operation to seek between columns.</p>
<p>A seek is efficient when it can seek past 5-10 KeyValue (columns) or 512-1024 bytes. With small rows and few versions look ahead is typically more efficient.</p>
<p>API: {code} Scan s = new Scan(...); s.addColumn(...); // instructs the RegionServer to attempt two iterations of next before scheduling a seek s.setAttribute(Scan.HINT_LOOKAHEAD, Bytes.toBytes(2)); table.getScanner(s); {code}</p>
