<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9850">HBASE-9850</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Issues with UI for table compact/split operation completion. After split/compaction operation using UI, the page is not automatically redirecting back using IE8/Firefox.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Support auto redirect for IE/firefox browsers upon completion of Split/compact operation</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9902">HBASE-9902</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Region Server is starting normally even if clock skew is more than default 30 seconds(or any configured). -&gt; Regionserver node time is greater than master node time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Clock skew detection to be made absolute value comparison. Any time difference between master or region, high or low must prevent the region server startup</p>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9138">HBASE-9138</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>getHaseIntegrationTestingUtility() is misspelled</strong></li>

<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9165">HBASE-9165</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Improvements to addDependencyJars</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Introduces the method TableMapReduceUtil#addHBaseDependencyJars for adding HBase and its direct dependencies (only) to the job configuration.</p>
<p>This is intended as a low-level API, facilitating code reuse between this class and its mapred counterpart. It is also of use to external tools that need to build a MapReduce job that interacts with HBase but want fine-grained control over the jars shipped to the cluster. See also PIG-3285 and HIVE-2055.</p>

</ul>
<p>$ ./bin/hbase mapredcp --help Usage: hbase mapredcp [-Dtmpjars=...] Construct a CLASSPATH containing dependency jars required to run a mapreduce job. By default, includes any jars detected by TableMapReduceUtils. Provide additional entries by specifying a comma-separated list in tmpjars.</p>
