<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.94.19-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.94.19 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10118">HBASE-10118</a> | <em>Minor</em> | <strong>Major compact keeps deletes with future timestamps</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes has been changed; if it is not set, or set to 0, all delete markers including those with future timestamp are purged during the later major compaction. Otherwise, a delete marker is kept until the major compaction after marker's timestamp + this setting.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10966">HBASE-10966</a> | <em>Trivial</em> | <strong>RowCounter misinterprets column names that have colons in their qualifier</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Applied to all branches (0.94 doesn't have TestRowCounter so didn't get test change). Thanks for the patch Alexandre.</p>
