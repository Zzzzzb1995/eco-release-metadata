<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.90.2-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.90.2 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3285">HBASE-3285</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>Hlog recovery takes too much time</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adds hbase exploitation of new lease recovery added by hdfs-1520. New API is available at tip of branch-0.20-append, in advance of the version of hadoop that ships with 0.90.1 hbase (r1057313). Must patch CDH to add the API.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-3674">HBASE-3674</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Treat ChecksumException as we would a ParseException splitting logs; else we replay split on every restart</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This commit changes our &quot;hbase.hlog.split.skip.errors&quot; from false to true. IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE!!!!! We're going to just archive corrupted files and keep going over them rather than stop forward motion.</p>
