<h1 id="apache-hbase-0.94.17-release-notes">Apache HBase 0.94.17 Release Notes</h1>
<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10249">HBASE-10249</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>TestReplicationSyncUpTool fails because failover takes too long</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This change also fixes a potential data loss issue when using ZK multi actions because region servers could try to failover themselves (the replication sync up tool acts as a RS too)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10470">HBASE-10470</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Import generates huge log file while importing large amounts of data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Committed to 0.94 and 0.96 as well.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10501">HBASE-10501</a> | <em>Critical</em> | <strong>Improve IncreasingToUpperBoundRegionSplitPolicy to avoid too many regions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Changes the default split policy to avoid too many regions with default settings. The old policy calculates the split size at each RS as follows: MIN(maxFileSize, flushSize*NoRegions^2) (NoRegions is the number of regions for the table in question seen on this RS)</p>
<p>The new policy calculates the size this way: MIN(maxFileSize, flushSize*2*NoRegions^3) Note that the initial split size is now 2 * the flushSize. With default settings it increased from 128mb to 256mb.</p>
<p>The new policy still allows spreading out the regions over the cluster quickly, but then grows the desired size fairly quickly in order to avoid too many regions per RS.</p>
