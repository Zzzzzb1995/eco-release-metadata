<li><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1949">HBASE-1949</a> | <em>Major</em> | <strong>KeyValue expiration by Time-to-Live during major compaction is broken</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed expiring of individual column values within rows via the column family time-to-live configuration. Previously all column values following the first expired value in a row would be truncated. Though in practice this might only be seen when lowering the TTL configuration on a column family with existing data.</p>
